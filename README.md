Layout of Code:

The code is split up into two classes. The first class is HexGame. This contains all the code needed to get the game to work, all the ai, and allows you to play the text based version.
The second class is a child of HexGame and is the HexGameUI class. This class contains all the code needed to get the UI to work on top of the HexGame code.

How to interact with the program:

To use the program scroll to the very bottom where main is. There are 10 lines of code. 
The first five lines are for playing the text-based version. 
The final five lines are for playing the UI-based version. 
Open terminal. Cd to the folder. Then run the command python3 -m hex. If the command doesn't work use the command python -m hex.

What does each file/folder do:

One file out of folder: hex.py
  This file contains all the functional code which you should run to be able to play hex game. This is the file you actually want to grade
  
One folder: Old_Code (the code may not work just from running might need to uncomment certain lines)
  This folder contains three folders:
    The first folder: GUI_V1
        This contains a file with the old version of the GUI
    The second folder: AI_V1
        This contains two files used to run the first version of the AI
    The third folder: AI_V2
        This contains a file used to run the second version of the AI
